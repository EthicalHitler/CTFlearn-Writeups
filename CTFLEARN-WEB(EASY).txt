2. My Blog



Hi, I'm Noxtal! I have hidden a flag somewhere in my Cyberworld (AKA blog)... you may find a good <strong>application</strong> for your <strong>memory</strong>. ;)

Note: This is my real website (thus no deadly bug to exploit here). You might want to read some of my content (writeups, tutorials, and cheatsheets). I would be glad to receive any kind of feedback.

Click here to access it, have fun checking my blog out! Cheers!

Hint: replace the flag{} part with CTFlearn{}.


* Examine the application tab and storage tab in inspect element.

FLAG : CTFlearn{n7f_l0c4l_570r463_15n7_53cur3_570r463}
